# ThreadingInAndroid
This project shows how Large task can be handled using child threads in Android using Traditional Threads and AsyncTask

While developing android apps, you will come accross a lot of situation where you need to perform heavy operation.
You can do that without blocking the UI thread, If you use the UI therad for performing heavy tasks you applicaation will crash.
You need to create seperate threads for this heavy operation which you can do in two ways which i did in this project.
1. Traditional Threads
2. Async Task
